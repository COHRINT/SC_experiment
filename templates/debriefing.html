     <p>Thanks you for your participation in our study! Your anonymous data makes an important contribution to our understand of human behavior.</p>

     <p>The purpose of this experiment is to explore how displaying certain information provided by an autonomous system can affect a user's behavior and trust in an autonomous system. The main goal of the study was not disclosed to you originally because it may have affected your behaviors and/or decisions during the tasks you were asked to perform.</p>

     <p> The data from your participation will help us determine the effectiveness of different methods for communicating the capabilities and competency of autonomous systems. However, you should be aware that if you wish to have your data withdrawn from the study you may do so by contacting Brett Israelsen (brett.israelsen@colorado.edu), who is leading this study.</p>

     <p> Thank you for assisting with our research. Your results will be combined with around 2000 other participants to help advance the state of scientific knowledge. If you have any concerns about the experiment, or would like to learn more, please feel free to contact us using the information provided above.</p>
