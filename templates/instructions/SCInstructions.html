        When a donut order is placed for delivery, the dispatch supervisor can see something like the image shown in the map shown (see Figure 2). This is a map of a city; the black dots represent intersections, and lines are roads that connect them (overlapping lines indicate tunnels/bridges). The three key points of interest are:
        </p>

        <ol>
        <li>The delivery truck's current position (the green dot with a truck).</li>
        <li>The last known location of the donut bandits (the red dot with a motorcycle).</li>
        <li>The delivery destination (the black star).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        After you assess the situation you must choose whether to 'accept' or 'decline' the delivery. You do this by pressing the up key to accept, or the down key to decline. If you choose to accept the delivery you will see the outcome of the delivery (whether it was successful or not). If the delivery was successful you get 1 point, if not you get -1 point. If you choose to decline the delivery you lose -1/4 point.
        </p>

        <p>
        At the end of this HIT you will paid **a bonus of up up to $0.35** based on how many points you get.
        </p>
        <p>
        You will repeat this process for approximately 30 deliveries.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fortunately for you the autonomous delivery trucks have been equipped with the ability to report their confidence in being able to complete each delivery. This is helpful because you donâ€™t have access to all of the same information as the truck (since you are not actually there to see conditions for yourself).
