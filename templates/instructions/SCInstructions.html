        When a donut order is placed for delivery, you will see something like the image shown below. This represents a map of a city; the black dots represent intersections, and lines are roads that connect them (if there are overlapping lines, these indicate a tunnel or a bridge).
        </p>

        <div id="trial"><img src="{{ server_location }}/static/images/transition_vary_1_net_4.svg" width="300" height="300" ></div>

        <p> The three key points of interest are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The delivery truck's current position (the green dot with a truck).</li>
        <li>The last known location of the donut bandits (the red dot with a motorcycle).</li>
        <li>The delivery destination (the black star).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        After you assess the situation you must choose whether to 'accept' or 'decline' the delivery. You do this by pressing the up key to accept, or the down key to decline. If you choose to accept the delivery you will see the outcome of the delivery (whether it was successful or not). The score breakdown is as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li> Successful delivery: <b><font color="blue">+1 point</font></b>
        <li> Failed delivery: <b><font color="blue">-1 point</font></b>
        <li> Declined delivery: <b><font color="blue">-1/3 point</font></b>
        </ul>

        <p>
        You will repeat this process for approximately 30 deliveries. At the end of this HIT you will paid <b>a bonus of up up to $1.00</b> based on your score and your and the effort you put in to the experiment (please don't push the same key the whole time, or randomly select responses without thinking).
        </p>
        <p>
        Remember, <b>you do not have direct access to all relevant information</b>. Fortunately for you the autonomous delivery trucks have been equipped with the ability to report their confidence in being able to complete each delivery.
