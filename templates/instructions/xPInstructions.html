    <h3>Your truck can report "Outcome Assessment" to help you</h3>

	<hr />

	<div class="instructions well">
	    <p>
        Outcome Assessment represents the truck's assessment of the possible outcomes. It can range from -1.0 to 1.0. When the truck reports -1.0 that represents that the truck is nearly certain of failure, a value of 1.0 means the truck is nearly certain of success. When the truck reports 0.0 there are equal chances of success and failure. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>If there is only one path to take to the customer, and the motorcycle gang is on that path, the truck's confidence will likely be low (near -1.0)</li>
        <li>If the city is a grid, that is easy to navigate, and it will also be easy to avoid the gang, then the truck's confidence will likely be high (near 1.0)</li>
        <li>If success/failure of a delivery depends on a single event going well (i.e. being able to make a certain light), then the truck may be uncertain and report a neutral value (near 0.0)</li>
        <ul>
