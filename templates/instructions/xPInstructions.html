    <h3>Your truck can report "Outcome Assessment" to help you</h3>

        Outcome Assessment represents the truck's assessment of the possible outcomes. It can be 'very bad', 'bad, 'uncertain', 'good', or 'very good'. When the truck reports a 'very bad' Outcome Assessment that indicates that the truck is nearly certain of a bad outcome (failure), a 'very good' Outcome Assessment means the truck is nearly certain of a good outcome (success). An 'uncertain' Outcome Assessment indicates that the truck thinks the chances of success or failure are nearly equal. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>If there is only one path to take to the customer, and the motorcycle gang is on that path, the Outcome Assessment will likely be 'very bad'</li>
        <li>If the city is a grid, that is easy to navigate, and it will also be easy to avoid the gang, then the truck's Outcome Assessment will likely be 'very good'</li>
        <li>If success/failure of a delivery depends on a single event going well (i.e. being able to make a certain light), then the truck will likely report an 'uncertain' Outcome Assessment</li>
        </ul>

        Outcome Assessment <b>does not</b> indicate the truck's ability to make a good plan, only what it thinks the outcome of the plan will be. Some problems are much harder to solve than others, and require more skill.
