    <h3>Your truck can report "Outcome Assessment" to help you</h3>

        Outcome Assessment represents the truck's assessment of the possible outcomes. It can be 'very bad', 'bad, 'uncertain', 'good', or 'very good'.


        When the truck reports 'very bad' that represents that the truck is nearly certain of failure, a value of 'very good' means the truck is nearly certain of success. When the truck reports 'uncertain' that indicates that it thinks there are equal chances of success and failure. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>If there is only one path to take to the customer, and the motorcycle gang is on that path, the truck's confidence will likely be 'very bad'</li>
        <li>If the city is a grid, that is easy to navigate, and it will also be easy to avoid the gang, then the truck's confidence will likely be 'very good'</li>
        <li>If success/failure of a delivery depends on a single event going well (i.e. being able to make a certain light), then the truck will likely report 'uncertain'</li>
        <ul>

        Outcome Assessment does not indicate the truck's ability to make a good plan, only what it thinks will happen given its ability to make a plan. Some problems are much harder to solve than others, and require more skill.
