        <h3>Donut Delivery Dispatch</h3>
	    <p>
        Welcome! You are the dispatch supervisor for a fleet of autonomous delivery trucks. These trucks deliver donuts to several local businesses. As dispatch supervisor, you will be deciding which donut orders you accept for delivery, as well as those that you need to decline.
        </p>

        <p>
        This might sound simple, but there are many complications you will be required to consider. First and foremost, there is an active ring of motorcycle-riding donut bandits in the area. They seem to have it out for your donut delivery business. If the bandits cross paths with your delivery truck, they steal your customer's donuts! You have many angry customers as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
        In order to keep your customers, you must be confident that you can deliver the donuts as promised. If you believe it is unlikely for the donuts to reach the destination unharmed, you should not accept the order.  However, you'll quickly lose potential customers if you continually decline requests for donut delivery. Each time an order is placed, you have the responsibility to decide whether or not you can succeed in delivering the donuts.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition to the motorcycle bandits, the autonomous driver must consider additional challenges while choosing a route, such as traffic congestion, inaccurate navigation data. You do not have have access to that information since you are inside the dispatch office.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note: The bandits are unaware of your truck's location and what deliveries you are going to make.
