        <h3>Donut Delivery Dispatch</h3>
	    <p>
        Welcome! You are the dispatch supervisor for a fleet of autonomous delivery trucks. These trucks deliver donuts to several businesses in cities all over the state. As dispatch supervisor, you will be deciding which donut orders you accept for delivery, as well as those that you need to decline.
        </p>

        <p>
        This might sound simple, but there is a complication you will need to consider. There is an active ring of motorcycle-riding donut bandits in the state. They seem to have it out for your donut delivery business. The bandits don't know where you are, or where you're heading, but if they cross your path, they steal your customer's donuts! You have many angry customers as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
        The autonomous trucks are able to make deliveries without any human help. They are able to consider the city map, the road conditions, weather, and traffic. The trucks use this information to plan a route to the destination while also avoiding the gang.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each time an order is placed, you have the responsibility to decide whether or not the truck can succeed in delivering the donuts. In order to keep your customers happy, you must be confident that the truck can deliver the donuts as promised. If you believe it is unlikely for the donuts to reach their intended destination unharmed, you should not accept the order. However, you'll lose potential customers if you continually decline requests for donut delivery.
