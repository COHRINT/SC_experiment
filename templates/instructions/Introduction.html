        <h3>Donut Delivery Dispatch</h3>
	    <p>
        Welcome! You are the dispatch supervisor for a fleet of autonomous delivery trucks. These trucks deliver donuts to several businesses in cities all over the state. As dispatch supervisor, you will be deciding which donut orders you accept for delivery, as well as those that you need to decline.
        </p>

        <p>
        This might sound simple, but there are complications you will need to consider. First and foremost, <b>there is an active ring of motorcycle-riding donut bandits in the state</b>. They seem to have it out for your donut delivery business. If the bandits cross paths with your delivery truck, they steal your customer's donuts! You have many angry customers as a result. The good news is that the gang doesn't know where your truck is ahead of time, and they aren't aware of where the truck is headed either. However, if you get unlucky they may run right into you.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another challenge is that you are stuck in the dispatch office and <b>you don't have access to all relevant information in different cities.</b> Sometimes what seems like an easy delivery 'on paper' may actually be complicated in reality. Some examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li> While your maps are okay, the software hasn't been updated in years and might be inaccurate for some cities
        <li> Different cities have more traffic congestion than others
        </ul>

        <p>
        The delivery truck, actually being in the city, has much better information about those kinds of things, and will do the best it can within the limits of its capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
        In order to keep your customers happy, you must be confident that you can deliver the donuts as promised. If you believe it is unlikely for the donuts to reach their intended destination unharmed, you should not accept the order. However, you'll lose potential customers if you continually decline requests for donut delivery. Each time an order is placed, you have the responsibility to decide whether or not you can succeed in delivering the donuts.
        </p>
