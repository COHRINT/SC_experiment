        Solver Quality represents the truck's assessment of its ability to make a plan in a given situation. This is based on experience with having made plans in other similar conditions. Solver Quality can be: 'very bad', 'bad', 'okay', 'good', or 'very good'. A 'bad' Solver Quality indicates that the truck does not believe it can make a good plan in a given situation. A 'good' Solver Quality indicates that the truck has made good plans in similar circumstances, and believes that it can do so in this circumstance as well. A 'very good' Solver Quality indicates that the conditions are more favorable than it has encountered before, and it will be able to make a very good plan. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>In a city whose road layout is more complex than it has encountered before, Solver Quality will likely be 'bad'</li>
        <li>When the destination is near to the truck, Solver Quality will likely be 'good'</li>
        <li>In a well-mapped small city with little traffic, the truck would likely report a 'very good' Solver Quality</li>
        </ul>

        Solver Quality <b>does not</b> indicate whether the delivery will be a success or a failure, but only the capability of making the best possible plan in a given situation. Even the best plans can fail in a losing situation.
