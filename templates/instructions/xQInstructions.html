        Solver Quality represents the truck's assessment of its ability to come up with a good plan. This is based on experience with having made plans in other similar conditions. It can range from 0.0 to 2.0. A value of 0.0 indicates that the truck does not believe it can make a good plan in this situation. A value of 1.0 indicates that, based on similar circumstances, the truck believes it will be able to match its best plans. A value of 2.0 indicates that it will be able to exceed its best plans made in similar conditions. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>In cities where the vehicle knows the road map is out of date the vehicle will report a low ability (near 0.0)</li>
        <li>In cities where there have been many well-maintained roads the vehicle will likely be confident in making a plan and report a high ability (near 1.0)</li>
        <li>On a Sunday where there is very little traffic the truck may be extremely confident that it can make a very good plan and will report a very high ability (near 2.0)</li>
        </ul>
