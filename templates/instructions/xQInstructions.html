        Solver Quality represents the truck's assessment of its ability to make a plan, which is based on previous plan making in similar situations. Solver Quality can be: 'very bad', 'bad', 'okay', 'good', or 'very good'. A 'bad' Solver Quality indicates that the truck does not think it will make a good plan based on previous experience. A 'good' Solver Quality indicates that the truck thinks it will be able to make a good plan. A 'very good' Solver Quality indicates that the truck is extremely confident in the plan it can make. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>In a city whose road layout is much more complex than has been encountered before, Solver Quality will likely be 'bad'</li>
        <li>When the destination is near to the truck, Solver Quality will likely be 'good'</li>
        <li>In a well-mapped small city with little traffic, the truck would likely report a 'very good' Solver Quality</li>
        </ul>

        Solver Quality <b>does not</b> indicate whether the delivery will be a success or a failure, but only the capability of making the best possible plan. Even the best plans can fail in a losing situation.
