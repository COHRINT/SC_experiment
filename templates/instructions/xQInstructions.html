        Solver Quality represents the truck's assessment of its ability to come up with a good plan. This is based on experience with having made plans in other similar conditions. It can be 'very bad', 'bad', 'okay', 'good', or 'very good'.

        A 'very bad' Solver Quality indicates that the truck does not believe it can make a good plan in a given situation. A 'good' Solver Quality indicates that the truck has made good plans in similar circumstances. A 'very good' Solver Quality indicates that the truck will be able to exceed its best plans made in similar conditions. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>In cities where the truck knows the road map is very poor it will be unconfident in it's capability and report a 'very bad' Solver Quality</li>
        <li>In cities where there have been many well-maintained roads the vehicle will likely be confident in its capability and report a 'good' Solver Quality</li>
        <li>In a city with a very accurate map, and little traffic the truck would likely report a 'very good' Solver Quality</li>
        </ul>

        Solver Quality <b>does not</b> indicate whether the outcome will be good or bad, but only the capability of making the best possible plan. Even the best plans can fail in a losing situation.
