                <h3>Title of research study: Ability to Process Complex Networks</h3>
                <h3>IRB Protocol Number: 18-0580</h3>
                Investigator: Brett Israelsen

                <h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
                <p>You are being invited to participate because you are at least 18 years old, have normal vision, or wear corrective lenses, are a fluent English speaker, and have not previously participated in the experiment.</p>

                <p>The purpose of the study is to identify how people are able to cope with making decisions when presented with many complex variables. Humans have a difficult time making decisions when there is a lot of complex information involved, and we would like to quantify that phenomenon. This study will help us understand how, in the future, we can design systems that assist in making decisions in complex and uncertain scenarios.</p>

                <p>We expect that you will be in this research study for between 5 and 10 minutes.  Your participation will end after you complete this HIT.</p>

                <p>We expect about 2,000 people will be in this research study.</p>

                <h3>Explanation of Procedures</h3>
                <p>The experimental condition in which you participate will be selected by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the researchers will select what condition you participate in. You will have an equal chance of being given each treatment.</p>

                <p>The study will involve the following procedure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> You will be using your own computer to complete the study at the time of your choosing.
                    <li> You will participate in a series of tasks, after a short training period. We anticipate this task to last between 5 and 10 minutes.
                    <li> The tasks in which you participate will require you to make a sequence of decisions. The decisions you make will affect your score.
                    <li> What you see on the screen will be manipulated as part of the study.
                    <li> We will record only your decisions, time to make them, and your worker ID. No personally identifiable information will be collected.
                    <li> We will also record responses to questions about your opinions about the experimental task. These responses will also be recorded for analysis.
                    <li> Your participation in this study will end after completing this HIT.
                </ul>

                <h3>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</h3>
                <p>Whether or not you take part in this research is your choice. You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. However, if you decide to leave the research early you will not be paid for your time.</p>

                <p>The person in charge of the research study can remove you from the research study without your approval. Possible reasons for removal include the inability to follow the study procedures.</p>

                <p>Data from this study will be stored on password protected computers that have a fully patched operating system and applications, current antivirus software with current virus definitions. Data may be stored in a cloud-based server. Access to data will be limited to authorized individuals.</p>

                <p>No identifying information will be obtained from subjects in any of the experiments that would tie specific responses to a given individual. Instead data will be stored using unique participant code numbers (i.e. worker IDs) rather than names. All experimental data will be stored without any identifying information in electronic form. This data will be made available to collaborators for research purposes without further confidentiality agreements as an open dataset. This dataset will be retained indefinitely. Sensitive information will not be collected as part of the proposed studies.</p>

                <h3>Potential Benefits</h3>
                <p>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. We do not foresee that participation in this study will benefit you personally. However, your participation will help us to be able to take human limitations into account when designing complex decision making tasks.</p>

                <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>Information obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research information that identifies you may be shared with the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board (IRB) and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to research, including people on behalf of the Office for Human Research Protections. The information from this research may be published for scientific purposes; however, your identity will not be given out.</p>

                <h3>Payment for Participation</h3>
                <p>If you agree to take part in this research study, we will pay you the rate of $8/hr for your time and effort. You will receive this payment electronically through Amazon Mechanical Turk. This amount will not be prorated for partial/incomplete participation. Bonus payments are available based on performance during the task.</p>

                <p>It is important to know that payment for participation is taxable income.</p>

                <h3>Questions</h3>
